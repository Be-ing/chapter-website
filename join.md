## This is a movement

When you become a dues-paying member, you get plugged in to Chicago's vibrant organzing community. Chicago DSA leads and participates in several [priority campaigns](../campaigns). Our [working groups](../working-groups) advance these strategies. Attend an event and meet our community!

## Become an official member

If you want to participate in working groups and vote on chapter issues, you need to become a national DSA member. Join as a **Movement Builder** and 20% of your dues will be shared directly with Chicago DSA.
