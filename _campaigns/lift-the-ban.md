Lift The Ban is a statewide effort advocating for economic well-being and stability for Illinois' families through repealing the Rent Control Preemption Act of 1997, and establishing rent control for Chicago residents.

The Lift the Ban Coalition consists of more than 30 groups that believe rent control is a necessary first step in taking back power from wealthy developers, curbing gentrification and displacement, and tackling Illinois' housing crisis.

The CDSA Lift the Ban campaign focuses on canvassing neighborhoods, lobbying local and state politicians and educating the public to build the movement for housing justice.
