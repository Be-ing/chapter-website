Democratize ComEd is a people-powered campaign for democratically controlled energy in Chicago. ComEd is Chicago's electricity provider, and their contract with the city is up for renewal in 2020. We're fighting for: 

- An elected utility board
- Public control of profits
- Fairer rates
- Aggressive renewable energy
- Green jobs to maintain the grid

**For the first time in 30 years, we have a chance to take control of our energy future.** By turning ComEd into a municipal utility controlled by the people of Chicago, for the people of Chicago, we can increase clean energy, get fairer rates, and put profits back into our community rather than into shareholdersâ€™ pockets.

Chicago DSA's involvement includes research, political education, communications, outreach, and direct action/canvassing.
