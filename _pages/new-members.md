## Attend a New Member Orientation

On the third Saturday of every month, a few wonderful comrades host introductory Zoom calls. We spend time getting to know each other, discuss the basics of socialism, and provide an overview of Chicago DSA's priority initiatives.

## Join Rose Buddies

As our membership grows, Chicago DSA is committed to finding the best way for everyone to participate in our chapter's work. Over a three-month period, a veteran DSA member will schedule check-ins, answer your questions, and connect you with chapter activities that fit your interests.
