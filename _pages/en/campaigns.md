Chicago DSA members work every week to build a city that works for the working class. These are priority areas that we have voted as a chapter to take on to focus our resources. In considering whether to take on a priority campaign, we consider whether the campaign will build working class power, raise class consciousness, give opportunities for political education, and whether we think it is a winnable fight.

Campaign organizing includes planning and strategy meetings, canvassing, calling our neighbors, planning actions, and organizing our communities and workplaces. These are our current priority campaigns.
