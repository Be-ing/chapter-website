At the national level, DSA members have formed several caucuses. They allow individuals with a shared socialist vision to organize and shape our priorities. In Chicago, we have two active caucuses.

## Afrosocialists and Socialists of Color

The Afrosocialists and Socialists of Color Caucus (AfroSOC) continues the tradition of radical Black, Indigenous, and minority organizing. Strategic goals include:

- Advocating for DSA's BIPOC membership and their communities
- Building a multiracial, working-class base
- Supporting and developing non-white DSA leaders

*Participation in AfroSOC does not require a DSA membership. It is BIPOC-only.* 

## Bread and Roses

[Bread and Roses](https://breadandrosesdsa.org/) believes in the centrality of class struggle and the imperative need to organize the working class. Their efforts are focused on:

- Using a rank-and-file strategy to militantly organize key industries
- Engaging with socialist parties and organizations in other countries
- Building a robust slate of political education
