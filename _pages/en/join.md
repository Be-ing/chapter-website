## Pay dues

If you want to participate in working groups and vote on chapter issues, you need to become a national DSA member. Join as a *Movement Builder* and 20% of your dues will be shared directly with Chicago DSA.

{% include comp-button.html text="Join national DSA" link="https://www.dsausa.org/join" %}

*Economic struggle will not divide us. [Dues waivers](https://dsausa.org/dueswaiver) are available.*

## We'll confirm you

Every Monday, we receive a list of new members and update our internal roster.

## Check your inbox

Every Sunday, we publish *This Week in CDSA*. Is it in your inbox? You're in Chicago DSA.

#### A special note:

22% of our funding comes from members who donate a little extra, and allies that are down with the cause. If you can afford it, set up a recurring or one-time donation. 100% of all donations benefit Chicago DSA campaigns and programs.
