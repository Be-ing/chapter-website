## Attend a new member orientation

On the last Wednesday of every month, Chicago DSA hosts an orientation call on Zoom. Chapter members answer questions like:

- What is democratic socialism? 
- What is DSA, and how is our chapter structured?
- How can I get involved?

Representatives from our [campaigns](campaigns) and [working groups](working-groups) will present their work, invite folks to join, and collect names.
