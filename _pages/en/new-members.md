## Attend *What is DSA?*

On the last Wednesday of every month, Chicago DSA hosts our virtual orientation. Chapter members will discuss:

- The basics of democratic socialism 
- DSA's national and local structures
- Ways to get involved

Representatives from our [campaigns](campaigns) and [working groups](working-groups) will present their work, invite folks to join, and collect names.
