As a national caucus with local affiliates, AFROSOC aims to continue legacy of radical Black organizing, as well as the traditions of other oppressed minorities. In Chicago, we stand on the shoulders of revolutionaries such as Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party and the Young Lords of Lincoln Park.

## Community is power

AFROSOC believes that in order to secure a socialist future, we must build a multiracial working-class base. We live in South Chicago and La Villita. In Pilsen and in Back of the Yards. We serve our neighbors through mutual aid, abolitionist canvassing, and solidarity in the streets. We develop non-white DSA leaders.
