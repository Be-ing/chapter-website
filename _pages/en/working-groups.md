The heart of Chicago DSA is our working groups. All members are encouraged to join a working group, and we seek participation from all expertises and backgrounds. These groups promote strategies and advance tactics that forward a working-class-centered politics of humanity and solidarity, effect positive change in Chicago's neighborhoods, and build relationships with other organizations with similar goals. 

Learn how to get involved in the working groups below and check out the [Events](https://teamup.com/ksc3uaa38o41o2vz8o?view=a) page to join an upcoming meeting.
